3 Course Assignment Activity for week 1

Differing probabilities with the loyalty points can be observed across the 3 comparisons of Age, Salary and Spend.

***Part 1: R Squared: probability that the dependant variable is influenced by loyalty points***

Age
- Age is not influenced / dependant on loyalty points
- R Squared is only 0.002 which means the percentage variation in dependent (Age) that is explained by independent (loyalty points) variable is only 2% 

Salary
- Salary show greater correlation with loyalty points
- R Squared is 0.380 which means 38% of Salary variable is dependant on loyalty points

Spend
- Spending shows the greatest correlation with loyalty points
- R Squared is 0.452 which means 45.2 of spend is dependant on loyalty points

***Part 2: Possible outliers***

The standard errors are:

Age: 0.481
Salary: 0.646
Spend: 0.685

The plots and standard errors suggest significant outliers exist.

***Part 3: P values***

P values are zero for salary and spend close to zero with a value of 0.058 for age.

***Part 4: Prob (F Statistic)***

Significant differences can be observed here between age when compared with salary and spend. The Age value is only 0.0577 compared to 2.43e and 2.92e for salary and spend respectively. This also indicates that the age variable is not influenced by the independant loyalty point variable.
